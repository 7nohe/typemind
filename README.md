- ‚ö° Fast: Sub-200ms response time target with offline capability
- üåç Universal: Works on any website with text input fields
- üéØ Context-Aware: Heuristic analyzer feeds tone/intent/topic signals into prompt selection
- üõ†Ô∏è Developer-Friendly: TypeScript + Vite + React + Tailwind

## Quick Start

### Installation (from source)

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Build the extension

```bash
npm run build
```

3. Load in Chrome

- Open chrome://extensions

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Type check
npm run typecheck

# Lint
npm run lint

# Watch build (rebuilds to dist/ on change)
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Run unit tests (Vitest)
npm test

# Production build
npm run build
```

Continuous integration (GitHub Actions) runs typecheck, lint, tests, and build on every push and pull request.

## Architecture

Built with modern web technologies:

- TypeScript 5.0+
- Chrome AI Prompt API (session reuse via `ChromeAIManager`)
- React + Tailwind for UI (Popup + Content overlay)
- Manifest V3 Service Worker
- Bundled with Vite (multi-entry)
